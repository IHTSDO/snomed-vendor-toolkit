# SNOMED CT Content

Reference sets (Refsets) are a flexible standard approach used by SNOMED CT to support a variety of requirements for customization and enhancement of SNOMED CT. These include the representation of subsets, language preferences for use of particular terms and mapping from or to other code systems.

Many users of SNOMED find it necessary to develop and implement Refsets for various use cases, including supporting specialized clinical domains, language translation, or simply to provide a smaller set of concepts when using SNOMED CT as an interface terminology.

The Refset resources provided in this toolkit have been generated by some of SNOMED Internationalâ€™s most advanced Member National Release Centres (NRCs).  The links will take you directly to their SNOMED content pages, with directions for download and use.

## Sample Refsets

For vendor interested in implementing reference sets that have been developed by SNOMED International Members, and made available to the SNOMED CT community at large.
